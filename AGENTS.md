# AGENTS.md — MicroRealEstate

> Open-source property management application for landlords. Microservices architecture, Node.js/TypeScript backend, Next.js frontends, MongoDB, Redis, Docker.

> **Single source of truth.** Agent-readable docs live in `.kiro/steering/`. Other tools read the same content via symlinks (`CLAUDE.md` → this file; `wasabi-toolbag/content/0N-*.md` → the 7 steering files). When updating documentation, edit the steering file. Never edit a symlink.

## Working principles for agents — read before debugging

When a live issue is reported (CORS error, login failure, deployment failure, container crash, etc.), **read the relevant code before proposing a fix.** Pattern-matching on log lines and error messages alone produces wrong answers fast and costs the user trust slowly.

The minimum sequence:

1. **Read the file emitting the error** — find the function that produced the message, read its full logic, and trace its inputs (env vars, config, imports). Do not skim.
2. **Read the helpers it depends on** — if the function uses `URLUtils.destructUrl()`, `bcrypt.compare()`, `jwt.verify()`, or any other shared utility, open that file too. The bug is often in the helper, not the caller.
3. **Verify your hypothesis with a read-only command** before changing anything — `curl` the endpoint with the exact `Origin`/`Authorization` headers, `mongo` query the actual record, `printenv` the running container.
4. **Then** propose a fix. State the root cause in one sentence and the proposed change in one sentence before editing files.

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- "Stale cookie" / "rate limit" / "cache" as default explanations when you haven't verified them. Check the logs for the specific request first.
- Patching env vars or config without reading the code that consumes them.
- Restarting services repeatedly hoping the symptom changes.
- Claiming a fix worked without re-running the failing command end-to-end.

If you cannot reproduce or verify a claim within 2-3 read commands, ask the user before continuing — it is cheaper than guessing wrong three times in a row.

## Quick triage: signin returns HTTP 500 locally

This is the #1 local-dev failure. The cookie/rate-limit theory is almost always wrong — start here instead.

1. **Check gateway logs first**: `finch logs microrealestate-gateway-1 2>&1 | grep -iE "cors|error" | tail -10`
2. If you see `CORS blocked origin: http://localhost:8080`: open `.env`, ensure `APP_DOMAIN=localhost:8080` is present, then **recreate** the gateway (don't just restart — `finch restart` does NOT reload env vars):
   ```
   finch rm -f microrealestate-gateway-1
   finch compose -f docker-compose.microservices.base.yml -f docker-compose.microservices.dev.yml up -d gateway
   ```
3. If you don't see CORS errors but the gateway is unreachable: verify `API_URL=http://api:8200/api/v2` is in `.env` (gateway crashes silently without it).
4. If credentials really don't match (auth code is reached but fails): the bcrypt hash in `accounts` collection may be from before the May 2026 double-hash fix. Reset directly in mongo — see `services/api/src/businesslogic/` for the bcrypt utility, or run `bcrypt.hash(password, 10)` inside the authenticator container and `db.accounts.updateOne(...)` inside mongo.

For a general "HTTP 500 from gateway" decision tree, see `.kiro/steering/test-running-guide.md`.

## Definition of "done" — read EVERY session before declaring anything fixed

**Nothing is fixed/working/shipped/verified until a Playwright browser drives the actual user flow against the deployed NAS UI and the assertions hold.** A green suite count is NOT proof. Manual browser spot-check (open http://192.168.0.96:1350/landlord/, sign in, do the thing) beats every test run. Existence assertions like `toBeVisible()` on a row that is also visible in the unfiltered list are tautologies, not coverage — use `toHaveCount(N)` or value-delta. Surfaces that need refetch-resilience coverage (type → wait → re-assert) are listed in `.kiro/steering/test-running-guide.md` "Definition of done"; ship the spec in the same PR as the change or the change is not done.

If you find yourself saying "the suite passes, it's working" — open the app in a browser first. The user has had to ask for this >20 times in this codebase. Don't make it 21.

## June 2026 — Recent state of play

Multi-day debugging session left the following lessons that future agents must internalize before changing anything:

### Timezone is the single most-bitten gotcha in this codebase

The Playwright suite, the seed helpers, the form-side date guards, and the server-side date guards all do `moment.utc(...)` vs `moment(...)` (local). On Athens (UTC+2 winter / UTC+3 summer) these can disagree by a calendar day at midnight or near month boundaries. Mismatches in either direction cause silent test failures or 422 rejections that look like app bugs.

**Rule:** if you see two `moment(...)` calls in the same comparison, BOTH must use `moment.utc(...)` OR neither — never mix. Anchors:

- `services/api/src/managers/rentmanager.ts` F3 guard — uses `moment.utc(p.date, 'DD/MM/YYYY', true)` AND `moment.utc(termFirstDay,'YYYY-MM-DD', true)` — consistent ✓
- `webapps/landlord/src/components/payment/PaymentTabs.js` `_handleSubmit` (around line 316) — fixed in `a9d3fbab`: `_parsed = moment.utc(...)`, `_termFirstDay = moment.utc(...)` ✓
- `e2e-playwright/tests/lib/api.ts` `ensureSeedLeasedTenantWithPayment` — uses `getMonth()` / `getFullYear()` (LOCAL) so the URL term matches the test's UI navigation (also LOCAL) ✓

If any of those drift back to mismatch, **every payment dialog test will time out at 15-22s** because the client-side guard fires a "Payment date is before this rent month" toast and the PATCH never goes out. That's exactly what happened in suites #7-#10 (June 1).

### The `b6165824 → dbf79562 → d5a5cb13` saga (do NOT repeat)

The dialog has a `submittingRef` with an 80ms `setTimeout` fallback that resets the ref if `formRef.isSubmitting()` is false. The intent is to recover from zod-rejected submits where neither `onSubmit` nor `onError` would fire. **Do not "tighten" or remove this timeout** — every attempt has broken the entire dialog flow. The 80ms value was load-bearing in the working-suite-6 baseline. The double-click race that C28 catches is a known edge case; accept the flake rather than drag the rest of the form down with you.

### Test seed leakage cascade

Spec 19 (lifecycle scenarios) creates fixtures (E2E-LeasedTenant-B) AND mutates the canonical fixture (sets `terminationDate` in L02). When a test panics mid-flow, the `afterAll` cleanup may not run. Subsequent suites then find:

1. **A second tenant whose name has E2E-LeasedTenant as a prefix** — substring-match selectors (`hasText: 'E2E-LeasedTenant'`) lock onto the wrong tenant. Use `:text-is("...")` for exact match.
2. **The canonical tenant terminated** — the tenant disappears from current+future rent grids. The Mongoose `update` path doesn't `$unset` cleanly when you PATCH `terminationDate: null`; you must drop directly into mongo and run `$unset: {terminationDate: ""}`. The `mre-mongo-1` container is mongo 4.4 (`mongo` shell, not `mongosh`).

If a Playwright run leaves the realm dirty, fix it via mongo before re-running. There is no `DELETE /api/reset` on NAS.

### The deploy script's bash exit-0 is a lie

`yarn deploy:nas` runs in the foreground (CI-wait poll + image pull + Portainer stack update + container revision verification). When you `&` it to background, bash returns exit 0 the moment it backgrounds — the actual deploy is still running. Always verify by polling Portainer for the container revision instead of trusting the exit code:

```bash
PT=$(cat .secrets/portainer-token)
curl -s "http://192.168.0.96:9000/api/endpoints/3/docker/containers/json?all=true" -H "X-API-Key: $PT" \
  | jq -r '.[] | select(.Names[0] | test("landlord-frontend")) | .Labels."org.opencontainers.image.revision"' \
  | cut -c1-8
```

Run that to confirm NAS is on the commit you pushed BEFORE running tests.

### Current state (June 1, 2026 — last suite #11)

- **Production NAS revision**: `a9d3fbab` (master). Health: `curl -s http://192.168.0.96:1350/landlord/` → 200.
- **Suite #11 result**: 133 passed / 5 failed / 1 skipped / 16 did not run (16.5 min wall time).
- **The 5 failures are all test bugs, not app bugs** — see `documentation/E2E_TESTING.md` for the catalog.
- **The 16 "did not run"** are spec 19 tests after L06 (serial mode bails on first failure).
- App-side bugs fixed in this session and shipped:
  - `7d888322` — TenantPropertyList missing `useTranslation` (tenants page error boundary)
  - `69e98638` — FormatMenu missing `useTranslation` (RichTextEditor crash)
  - `669d8d75` — `frontdata.toRentData` JSON.parse undefined when PATCH-ing future term with no rent record (500 → graceful empty)
  - `a9d3fbab` — PaymentTabs date guard timezone mismatch (the load-bearing fix; 36 dialog tests recovered)

Gateway routing order (first match wins):
1. `/api/v2/authenticator/*` → Authenticator
2. `/api/v2/documents/*`, `/api/v2/templates/*` → PDFGenerator
3. `/api/v2/*` → API (catch-all)
4. `/tenantapi/*` → TenantAPI
5. `/api/reset/*` → ResetService (non-prod)
6. `/landlord/*` → Landlord Frontend
7. `/tenant/*` → Tenant Frontend

## Key Entry Points

| To understand... | Start at |
|------------------|----------|
| Service bootstrap | `services/common/src/utils/service.ts` — shared `Service` singleton |
| API routes | `services/api/src/routes.ts` — all landlord API endpoints |
| Rent computation | `services/api/src/businesslogic/` — 7-step pipeline |
| Auth middleware | `services/common/src/utils/middlewares.ts` — `needAccessToken`, `checkOrganization` |
| Gateway proxy | `services/gateway/src/index.ts` — route-to-service mapping |
| Landlord app pages | `webapps/landlord/src/pages/[organization]/` — org-scoped routes |
| Store/auth context | `webapps/landlord/src/store/` — Organization, User, AppHistory classes |
| API call layer | `webapps/landlord/src/utils/restcalls.js` — all API functions |
| Axios interceptor | `webapps/landlord/src/utils/fetch.js` — token refresh logic |
| Mongoose models | `services/common/src/collections/` — all collection schemas |
| TypeScript types | `types/src/common/collections.ts` — `CollectionTypes` namespace |

## Data Layer

**Collections** (in `services/common/src/collections/`): Account, Realm, Tenant (Occupant), Property, Lease, Template, Document, Email.

**Critical naming gotcha:** The Mongoose model for tenants is registered as `'Occupant'` (`mongoose.model('Occupant', ...)`), but TypeScript types and API routes use `Tenant`. When querying MongoDB directly, use `Occupant`.

**Multi-tenancy:** All data is scoped by `realmId`. The `checkOrganization` middleware resolves the Realm from the `organizationId` request header and attaches it to `req`. Every downstream query filters by `realmId`.

**Rent terms** use `YYYYMMDDHH` format (e.g., `2026040100` for April 2026). Rent history is embedded in `tenant.rents[]` — not a separate collection.

## Frontend Patterns

The landlord app has completed migration from Material UI v4 → shadcn/ui + Tailwind, Formik + Yup → react-hook-form + zod, and MobX → React Query. Follow these patterns for all new code:

| Concern | Use | Avoid |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Server state | `@tanstack/react-query` (`useQuery`, `useMutation`) | Direct fetch, MobX stores |
| Auth/session | `StoreContext` (plain classes + `useSyncExternalStore`) | MobX, global state |
| Forms | `react-hook-form` + `zod` + `zodResolver` | Formik, Yup |
| UI components | `src/components/ui/` (shadcn/ui) + Tailwind | `@material-ui/*` |
| API calls | `apiFetcher()` from `src/utils/fetch.js` | Direct axios |

**Store reactivity:** Store classes use `subscribe(listener)` / `notify()`. `InjectStoreContext` uses `useSyncExternalStore`. `withAuthentication` and `useFillStore` read from `getStoreInstance()` singleton (not `useContext`) to avoid timing issues.

**New pages** go in `src/pages/[organization]/`. Feature components in `src/components/<feature>/`. React Query hooks in `src/hooks/`.

## API Routes

All landlord API routes are prefixed `/api/v2/` and require `Authorization: Bearer {token}` + `organizationId` header.

**Referential integrity enforced:**
- DELETE property → 422 if occupied by tenant
- DELETE lease → 422 if used by tenants
- DELETE tenant → 422 if has recorded payments

For the complete endpoint reference, read `services/api/src/routes.ts` and the matching route handlers under `services/api/src/`.

## Authentication

- **Landlord:** JWT access token (Bearer header) + refresh token (cookie). Access tokens ~5min, refresh tokens in Redis.
- **Tenant:** OTP via email → `sessionToken` cookie.
- **Middleware chain:** `needAccessToken` → `checkOrganization` → role checks.
- **Principal types:** `user`, `application`, `service`. **Roles:** `administrator`, `renter`, `tenant`.

## Repo-Specific Tooling

**Yarn 3.3.0 (Berry)** with PnP disabled. Monorepo with Yarn Workspaces.

**Pre-commit hook** (Husky): runs `yarn lint` which triggers ESLint + Prettier on staged files.

**ESLint config** (`.eslintrc.json`): `eslint:recommended` + `plugin:import/recommended` + `prettier`. Enforces sorted imports, single quotes, semicolons, unix line endings.

**Prettier** (`.prettierrc.json`): `semi: true`, `tabWidth: 2`, `singleQuote: true`, `trailingComma: "none"`.

**Docker Compose overlays:**
- `docker-compose.microservices.base.yml` — all service definitions
- `docker-compose.microservices.dev.yml` — volume mounts, hot reload
- `docker-compose.microservices.prod.yml` — restart policies, resource limits
- `docker-compose.microservices.test.yml` — adds resetservice
- `docker-compose.yml` — standalone with Caddy (auto HTTPS)

**CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): push to `master` → lint → build & push 8 Docker images to GHCR (parallel). The fork strips upstream's deploy and e2e jobs; the canonical upstream pipeline (9 images including tenant-frontend, plus deploy → health check → Cypress E2E) is preserved on `microrealestate/microrealestate`. **E2E on this fork** is Playwright at `e2e-playwright/`, runs against the live NAS (not CI) — see [`documentation/E2E_TESTING.md`](documentation/E2E_TESTING.md).

For NAS deployment specifics, see `documentation/DEV_AND_DEPLOY.md`.

**TypeScript build order:** `types` → `common` → individual services (each has its own `tsconfig.json`).

**Container runtime note:** Local development uses `finch` (not Docker). All compose commands use `finch compose`.
